Hi, all these are the source code for my research project, where I collaborated
with Gabriel Chu and Kho Tze Jit .
The research paper can be found at https://oar.a-star.edu.sg/jspui/handle/123456789/2300
Most of my work is in PicLoader.cs (BCIREBORN -> BCILibCS -> MotorImagery ->
PicLoader.cs). The rest of the files were inherited from the research institution
as we built our project on top of existing research.

The function of the PicLoader.cs file is to run our experiments and collect
all the data required for analysis.
